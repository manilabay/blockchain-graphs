# Interledger Protocol - ILP

Status: WIP

## Architecture

## Quick ELI5 explanation

Left graph show Interledger Protocol Architecture. There are 4 options path for a payment from Sender to Receiver:

* a) Blue path: Using only 1 connector + 1 ledger (Apparently Cheaper). Blue path failed because Sender didn't accept the Quote in step 3.
* b) Green path: Using more than a connector + ledger (Apparently Expensive)
* c) Red path: Timeout expire or Receiver hasn't the right private key. So the asset roll back through all the connector and ledgers involved.
* d) Black path: N/A, It is not used, just to an example to show how ILP routing features works, so the black workflow is not used: Connector_D, ledger_D asset_D asset_H asset_I asset_J asset_X asset_Y asset_Z

"Apparently", Blue path seems the cheapest because less Ledger involved less fees involved, but ILP is about multi-hop payments and it could be possible than multiple chain connectors is cheaper than 1 connector due the fees and another ledger performance factors because connectors could agreed and interchange assets with another transactions in transit to reduce costs.

### Components

* Ledger: Store Records. Ledger in ILP could be decentralized(1 entity) or decentralized(n entities) blockchain or DLTs. 1 Ledger track 1 Asset. An **important Ledger feature** in ILP it can support positive or negative balances, so it could maintain assets or liabilities. Architecture above show multiple assets and liability_R.

* Connector: Normally ILP manage it as a Plugin, as it is a program to speak with different ledgers. It gets revenue when transfer from one connector to another. It creates a smart contract inside the blockchain/ledger with a timeout and a transaction agreed by 2 parties: sender and receiver. Connectors also generate quotes.

* Asset: It represents any abstract/logical value, the balance is saved in the blockchain/ledger. As usually in blockchains, assets could be used only when provide the private key. Asset and liabilities are the same but asset is unlock with owner private key and liability is unlock with counter party owner private key.

###Â Workflow explanation by Arrows number

1. Sender init the payment choosing asset_A as mutual asset between Sender and Receiver
2. Connector_A prepare a quote and offer to Sender
3. Sender reject the Connector_A quote
4. Connector_B confirm than Receiver hasn't Asset_B through the Ledger_B and the Receiver Public key and prepare another quote(Ledger_B) to send to another Connector in the network.
5. Connector_B request Connector_C to check the same and transfer the operation and his quote to Connector_C
6. Connector_C confirm Receiver has Asset_C checking in ledger_C by Receiver public key and send the quote for Connector_B and Connector_C to Sender
7. Sender accept the quote so the payment start
8. Connector_B write in ledger_B the info and fee
9. Connector_C write in ledger_C the info and fee
10. If receiver has the right private key and accept the payment within the time agreed, then Receiver get the Asset. Otherwise rollback operation start and the Asset return to the Sender automatically through all the red path.
11. asset_C balance is saved into Ledger_C and Receiver have access to asset_C.

## Cryptographic ILP Transaction workflow (self-explained)

![Interledger Protocol Transaction](interledger-protocol-transaction.png?raw=true "Interledger Protocol Transaction")

### Some facts
Sender choose the Asset to do the payment and accept a quote for the connector chain, once quote(and connector chain) is accepted payment start. Receiver could get the payment through asset_A or asset_C.

## ILP Q&A to research

* Could the receiver choose the asset to get the payment? I understood no, because if receiver could choose which asset to receive it could unfair due the fee is payed by the sender only.

# IPFS

Status: WIP

![IPFS](ipfs.png?raw=true "IPFS")

# Hyperledger

# Ethereum

* Permissionless blockchain to access and operate in the network
* PoW (Homestead version) with CPU and Memory (ASIC-proof) + PoS (Serenity version)
* Private key to lock Addresses and Smart Contracts
* Dapps development
* Crypto-fuel (aka Gas) to use the blockchain to compute, transfer and storage.

![Ethereum Architecture](ethereum-architecture.png?raw=true "Ethereum")

Basically:

* Green arrows represent sync workflow for all the public ethereum network
* Black arrows represent components whichever node has and actions could run
